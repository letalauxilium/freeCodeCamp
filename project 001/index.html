TO DO
    stuff demonstrated in tutorials:
        - header texts
        - ordered/unordered lists
        - buttons
            animations in general are annoying... but the library should be browsed a bit.
        - rounded images!
    stuff in the code:
        - css: control styles of certain classes
        - element is basic unlabelled, class is addition of stuff that already exists, id is arbitrary

    I love Devola!

    HEADER IMAGE: Centered. Goes all the way across. Stays still when scrolling.
    MAIN BODY: 
        Margins from edge of the screen.
        Two main columns. Left is text, should take up maybe 3/4 width. Right is static image.
            TEXT:
                Write some opinions.                
                Then copy paste the lyrics.
                There's not actually enough text to fill the vertical space.
            STATIC IMAGE:
                Devola's concept art.
    FOOTER IMAGE: same logic as header.

                <p>Devola and Popola are twins from the videogame <i>
                NieR</i>, and its sequel, <i>NieR:Automata</i>.</p>
                <p>In <i>NieR</i>, they are the matriarchs of the protagonist's
                home village. Popola resides in a library of books from a past
                civilization that only she can read, and handles most of the more
                complicated tasks. Devola can be found first outside near the
                fountain, then later in the tavern, and is quite carefree in
                comparison. She spends her days playing a lute, a tune which
                serves as the background track for the village, and, if you're
                close enough nearby, you can hear her sing along.</p>
                <p>It's a song she doesn't really understand.</p>

                <blockquote><i>What kind of idiot sings a song without knowing what it means?!</i></blockquote>
                <blockquote><i>...This kind of idiot?</i></blockquote>

                <p>Their main functions as videogame NPCs are to provide quests
                Popola, with her position and access to vast amounts of knowledge,
                is a stopping point every now and again along the storyline.
                Devola with her free time listens and chats with villagers who pass by,
                and relays to us optional sidequests we can take. These sidequests make up
                a fair portion of the game's playtime, perhaps half the total hours by the end.
                These sidequests are the flavor and worldbuilding for the game's story -
                just like how Devola is the flavor to Popola.</p>
                
                <p>One sidequest chain involves collecting strange ingredients to brew a
                special alcoholic drink allows you to ask Popola to come out to the inn
                and sing a duet version with Devola. Devola apparently doesn't get any though,
                because under the influence she "gets a bit too friendly".</p>

                <p>In <i>Automata</i> they are travellers who happened to be in the area.
                They are no longer matriarchs, but outcasts, for a crime everyone everywhere
                will forever find unforgivable. But, they have unique skills, so they're begrudgingly
                allowed to be around to do work no one else can do. They're the same old Devola
                and Popola though - what could have happened?</p>

                <br>
                
                <p>The song Devola (and Popola) sings, which is never explicitly named in-universe,
                has the title <b>Song of the Ancients</b>. Over the course of the two games the song makes
                appearances in multiple versions at multiple times. In this player's opinion, this song,
                its various remixes, and its implementations make it the best piece of music ever composed.</p>

                <p>The song's lyrics, as well as more information about Devola and Popola, can be found below.</p>

                <br>

                <p>If you haven't already, I hope you consider playing Devola and Popola's games!</p>

    REVIEW

    biggest problem that took the longest time to understand was parallax. turns out it wasn't that hard
    but needed to learn how to read other peoples code and search for documentation/explanations.

    figuring out how to put text on top of an image took a while because i thought nesting worked in
    some other way. doing it the second time with the main text body was much easier.

    both of the above problems were solved with the help of a codepen discovered by name via google:

    https://codepen.io/keithclark/pen/JycFw

    the other fancy problem was how to make the main text body work like my blog on wordpress: a
    pixel width with background image around the sides, until reduced to a certain width, at which point
    it's percentage based. inspecting my blog produced no results. just thinking about it it seemed impossible
    to execute with just nesting; there had to either be a special element dedicated to such a thing, or
    some kind of logic which switched based on width condition. eventually browsing w3schools found that,
    yes, there is logic available after all. an if/else statement by another name.

    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp

    misc: 
    - built in Visual Studio Code.
    - <br> has to go at the end, not the start. doesn't seem important in left-align, but screws things up in right-align.
