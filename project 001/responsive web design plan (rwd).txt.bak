intent: have a different column setup depending on the width
tool: CSS "@media", preferably with Bootstrap columns

	[class*="col-"] {
		width: 100%
		}
	@media only screen and (min-width: 768px){
		.col-m-1 {width: 8.33%}
		...
		}

this is the basic setup. essentially an if/else statement.

	<div>
		I love Devola etc.
	</div>

if we want to put text in the center space and have background image on the sides, then the image probably has to go at the <div> level, and have columns that are transparent...

wordpress has a base single fluid column, then at some point it becomes fixed pixel width and the bg grows...

	[class*="col-"]{
		width: 100%;
	}
	
	@media only screen and (min-width: 1000px){
		.col-main {width: 1000px;}
	}
